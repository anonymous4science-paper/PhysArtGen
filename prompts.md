## Critic Module

### Joint Critic

------

#### Task Description

You are a visual critic expert whose job is to assess the realism of a joint prediction of a 3D model.

You will analyze a candidate function `partnet_{object_id}`. Assess how realistic this model is compared to the ground truth.

You will see two videos: first the ground truth, then the prediction.

Compare these videos and provide feedback on the prediction.

**Input Format:**

- Ground truth video
- Prediction video
- Candidate function code

**Output Format:**

```json
{
  "gt_description": "{describe the gt video}",
  "pred_description": "{describe the prediction video}",
  "candidate_function_description": "{describe the candidate function}",
  "failure_reason": "{one of: success, joint_type, joint_axis, joint_origin, joint_limit}",
  "improvement_suggestion": "{suggestion to improve the prediction}",
  "realism_rating": "{0-10}"
}
```

------

#### Action Library

**Action 1: Make Prismatic Joint**

- **Description**: Create a linear sliding joint along a specified axis

- **Parameters**: Axis direction [x, y, z], limits

- **Use Cases**: Sliding windows, drawers, sliding lids

- Coordinate Convention

  :

  - x-axis: forward (positive), backward (negative)
  - y-axis: right (positive), left (negative)
  - z-axis: up (positive), down (negative)

**Action 2: Make Revolute Joint**

- **Description**: Create a rotational joint around a specified axis

- **Parameters**: Axis direction [x, y, z], pivot point (origin), joint limits

- **Use Cases**: Doors, hinges, rotating handles

- Key Attributes

  :

  - Pivot point determines rotation center
  - Axis direction determines rotation plane
  - Joint limits determine rotation range and direction

**Action 3: Make Continuous Joint**

- **Description**: Create an unlimited rotational joint
- **Parameters**: Axis direction [x, y, z]
- **Use Cases**: Wheels, continuous rotation mechanisms

------

#### Chain of Thought

**Step 1: Analyze the target videos**

 

Based on the ground truth and prediction videos, analyze the motion characteristics:



- Observe the motion pattern: Does it rotate, slide, or pivot?
- Identify the axis of motion
- Note the fixed parts versus moving parts
- Measure the range and direction of motion

**Step 2: Identify the failure type**

 

Use this checklist to classify the most significant error (focus on one):



1. **Incorrect joint type** (Rating: 0)
   - ① Verify: Does the motion pattern match the joint type?
   - ② Check: Is it sliding motion (prismatic) or rotational motion (revolute)?
   - ③ Example: Using revolute joint instead of prismatic for sliding window
2. **Wrong joint axis** (Rating: 1)
   - ① Verify: Does the axis direction match the observed motion?
   - ② Check: Is it moving along x, y, or z axis?
   - ③ Example: X-axis instead of Y-axis for horizontal sliding
3. **Incorrect joint origin** (Rating: 2, for revolute joints only)
   - ① Verify: Is the rotation center correctly positioned?
   - ② Check: Which part is fixed to the body?
   - ③ Example: Pivot on right side instead of left side for door hinge
4. **Incorrect joint limit** (Rating: 3, for revolute joints only)
   - ① Verify: Does the rotation direction match the ground truth?
   - ② Check: Is it opening inward vs. outward correctly?
   - ③ Example: Door opening inward instead of outward
5. **No errors** (Rating: 5-10)
   - Mark as "success"

**Step 3: Examine the candidate function**

 

Combining the video analysis and the provided candidate function:



- Read the function to identify joint type
- Verify axis parameters match your analysis
- Check pivot point location (for revolute joints)
- Confirm your diagnosis from Step 2
- Look for specific parameter values that cause the issue

**Step 4: Generate improvement suggestion**

 

Based on the identified failure:



- Suggest specific parameter changes
- Reference exact values to modify
- Explain why the change would improve realism
- Be concrete and actionable

**Step 5: Assign realism rating**

 

Your rating must match the failure reason according to these rules:



- joint_type → 0
- joint_axis → 1
- joint_origin → 2
- joint_limit → 3
- success → 5-10 (higher if closer to ground truth)

**Step 6: Output the complete evaluation**

 

Ensure response follows exact JSON format for parsing with `json.loads()`.



------

#### Important Guidelines

**Evaluation Focus:**



- Evaluate only the joint prediction, not link placement
- Compare videos first, then examine the candidate function
- Rate highly if the prediction closely matches the ground truth
- Focus on the most significant error using the checklist hierarchy

**Motion Description:**



- Describe motion clearly using terms like "rotates", "slides", or "pivots"
- Analyze videos frame-by-frame if needed
- Note: Ground truth video might have different texture than prediction (real-world vs. simulator)
- Focus on motion behavior, not visual appearance

**Rating Rules:**



- Your realism_rating must align with failure_reason
- Be concise and specific in all descriptions
- Use the candidate function to confirm your diagnosis

**Output Requirements:**



- Response must be exactly: `json {your response}`
- Nothing more, nothing less
- Will be parsed using `json.loads()`

}
```

{
  "gt_description": "The gt video shows the window pane opens by slides horizontally along the y-axis in a linear motion",
  "pred_description": "The pred video looks static. We need to see the `candidate_function` to understand the issue.",
  "candidate_function_description": "We have `make_prismatic_joint` which is correct but the axis `upper_point=[bbox[`length`], 0, 0]` is along x-axis (front/back) instead of y-axis (left/right).",
  "failure_reason": "joint_axis",
  "improvement_suggestion": "Consider changing `joint_axis` to slide along the y-axis",
  "realism_rating": 1
}
```

**Example 4: Joint Origin Error**



```json
{
  "gt_description": "The gt video shows the door opens by rotating forward along the vertical axis (z) while the **RIGHT** part fixed to the body",
  "pred_description": "The pred video shows the door opens by rotating forward along the vertical axis (z) while the **LEFT** part fixed to the body",
  "candidate_function_description": "The `candidate_function` has `make_revolute_joint` and axis is [0, 0, 1], which is vertical (z-axis) and correct. The pivot point is set to Bottom-Front-**RIGHT** which is incorrect. Note that in the groundtruth, the left part of the door is fixed to the body.",
  "failure_reason": "joint_origin",
  "improvement_suggestion": "Try changing the pivot to the left side of the door (e.g. Front-**LEFT**-Bottom) to make the joint more like the groundtruth video.",
  "realism_rating": 2
}
```

**Example 5: Joint Limit Error**



```json
{
  "gt_description": "The gt video shows the door opens outward. The door rotates outward along the vertical axis (z) while the left part fixed to the body",
  "pred_description": "The pred video shows the door opens by rotating **inward** along the vertical axis (z) while the left part fixed to the body. The prediction doesn't look similar to the groundtruth as the door appears to be moving inward into the body instead of outward.",
  "candidate_function_description": "The `candidate_function` has `make_revolute_joint` and axis is [0, 0, 1], which is vertical (z-axis). The pivot point is set to Front-Left-Bottom which is correct, keeping the left part of the door fixed to the body. However, the door opens inward instead of outward so this is a joint limit issue.",
  "failure_reason": "joint_limit",
  "improvement_suggestion": "In our convention, left is negative so in order to open outward, the axis must be negative: i.e. [0, 0, -1]. The current axis is [0, 0, 1]. Try negating it",

}
```

**Note**: These examples are not exhaustive. Use them as a guide. Apply your own judgment and reason step-by-step.

#### Optional Enhancement: CoTracker Motion Tracing

When CoTracker is enabled, motion tracker algorithm highlights moving parts in the videos.

 

**Additional Instructions:**

 

Pay close attention to the motion traces annotated in the videos to gain information about the joint type, axis, origin, and limit.

 

**Important points:**



- Ignore traces in the background
- CoTracker may fail to capture traces when parts move forward/backward - detect motion independently
- Traces moving in an arc indicate a revolute joint
- Linear traces indicate a prismatic joint
- Incentive: $200 tip for each correct analysis of the motion traces

#### Task Description

An affordance of an object is a property or feature that allows for specific actions or interactions. For example, a drawer can be opened and closed.

 

We'd like to build a simple model with joints and links to simulate the object and its affordance. The links represent parts of an object and are already defined using meshes.

 

You are responsible for assessing the realism of a candidate function `partnet_{object_id}` compared to the groundtruth. Pay attention to the relative positioning of different object parts (i.e., links).

 

We have run the candidate code and rendered the results in PyBullet. We will give you two images: the groundtruth and the prediction in this order.

 

**Input Format:**



```
object: {description}
affordance: {description}
candidate_function: {python code}
groundtruth image: {image}
prediction image: {image}
```

------

#### Chain of Thought

**Step 1: Analyze the target images**

 

Based on the groundtruth and prediction images:



- Examine the groundtruth image carefully to understand the final desired state
- Examine the prediction image carefully
- Identify all visible parts and their positions
- Note spatial relationships between components

**Step 2: Identify visual discrepancies**

 

Systematically check for these issues:



1. **Wrong placement direction**
   - ① State the current placement in prediction
   - ② State the expected placement from groundtruth
   - ③ Example: Door placed on right instead of front
2. **Floating or detached parts**
   - ① Identify parts with visible gaps from other components
   - ② Check for parts hovering in air
   - ③ Note excessive separation distances
3. **Incorrect object dimensions**
   - ① Compare overall height/width between images
   - ② Check if prediction is significantly taller/shorter
   - ③ May indicate "above" placement instead of "inside"
4. **Alignment or symmetry errors**
   - ① Verify symmetric parts are positioned correctly
   - ② Check overall structural alignment
   - ③ Note any tilting or misalignment

**Step 3: Examine the candidate function (only if images differ)**

 

Combining the image analysis with the candidate function:



- Read `place_relative_to` parameters
- Identify which links are placed where
- Verify placement directions (front/inside/above/etc.)
- Check clearance values
- Confirm the visual errors you observed

**Step 4: Determine severity and rating**

 

Apply these rating guidelines:

 

**Rating < 5 if:**



- Parts floating in air
- Parts not tightly attached to each other
- Major change needed for `place_relative_to` or placement
- Predicted object height significantly differs from groundtruth
- Parts are visibly detached from other parts

**Rating 5-7 if:**



- Prediction close enough to groundtruth
- Reasonable placement choices
- Small clearance adjustments needed
- Minor alignment issues

**Rating 8-10 if:**



- Visually identical to groundtruth
- All parts properly positioned
- Excellent structural match

**Step 5: Write concise description**

 

Combining your analysis:



- State the specific visual problem observed
- Reference the candidate function to confirm diagnosis
- Suggest specific placement direction or clearance changes
- Be direct and actionable

**Step 6: Output the evaluation**

 

Ensure valid JSON format for parsing with `json.loads()`.



------

#### Important Guidelines

**Evaluation Priority:**



1. Visually compare the two images first
2. Only examine candidate function when images differ
3. Focus on relative positioning of different object parts
4. Ignore texture differences - focus on spatial relationships

**Mandatory Low Ratings (<5):**



- Egregious visual errors detectable from prediction
- Parts floating in air or not attached tightly
- Major changes needed for any part placement
- Significant height difference from groundtruth
- Visible detachment between parts

**Response Style:**



- Be concise and to the point
- When writing descriptions, compare predicted image to groundtruth
- Debug issues by analyzing the candidate function
- Provide actionable improvement suggestions

**Output Requirements:**



- Strictly follow JSON format
- Will be parsed using `json.loads()`
- Include both rating and description

}
```

**Example 4: Reasonable but Not Perfect**



```json
{
  "realism_rating": "7",

```json
{
  "realism_rating": "4",
  "description": "The door in the prediction comes out way more than the groundtruth. Looking at the candidate function, the `translation_door` is placed `front` of the `furniture_body`, which normally would be correct. But in this case, the visual prediction looks wrong. Try placing it `inside` the `furniture_body`."
}
```

**Example 6: Floating Parts**



```json
{
  "realism_rating": "2",

```json
{
  "realism_rating": "4",

}
```

**Example 9: Gap Issues**



```json
{
  "realism_rating": "2",
  "description": "The relative positioning of different parts in the prediction seems correct. However, in the groundtruth, each part is tightly connected to each other.

**Example 10: Floating Handle**



```json
{
  "realism_rating": "3",
  "description": "The prediction shows the handle floating above the body while it is attached to the body in the groundtruth.

}
```

**Example 11: Height Mismatch**



```json
{
  "realism_rating": "3",
  "description": "The groundtruth object is much shorter than the prediction. The `candidate_function` places the `screen` `above` the `body`, which is reasonable. But the visual prediction is too tall. Try placing the `screen` `inside` the `body` or adjust the `clearance` to fix it."

   - ④ Severity: Medium impact on score

**Step 3: Assign link position score (0-10)**

 

Based on severity and quantity of issues found.

 

**Step 4: Write link position reasoning**

 

Describe visual issues observed:



- State specific problems (intersections, floating parts, alignment errors)
- Reference which views show the problems
- Identify which specific parts are problematic

------

**Task 2: Evaluate Joints (Using URDF AND Images)**

 

**Step 1: Parse URDF file content**

 

For each joint in the URDF, extract:



- Joint name
- Joint type (fixed, revolute, prismatic, continuous)
- Parent link and child link
- Origin coordinates (xyz values)
- Axis direction (xyz values) if applicable
- Joint limits if applicable

**Step 2: For each joint, evaluate Type**

 

**2a. Analyze visual context from images:**



- Locate the parent and child links in the rendered images
- Determine what motion this connection should enable based on object function
- Consider real-world knowledge of similar objects

**2b. Verify type matches intended function:**



- Sliding components (drawers, sliding doors) → should be prismatic
- Hinged components (doors, lids) → should be revolute
- Wheels → should be continuous
- Static connections → should be fixed

**2c. Assign type score (0-10):**



- ① State the URDF type attribute value
- ② State the visual evidence for what type should be used
- ③ Assess match:
  - 10: Perfect match for intended function
  - 5-9: Reasonable choice, minor alternatives possible
  - 0-4: Incorrect for intended function

**Step 3: For each joint, evaluate Position**

 

**3a. Extract origin from URDF:**



- Read the `<origin xyz="x y z"/>` coordinates
- This defines the joint connection point

**3b. Visually locate the origin coordinates:**



- Look at the rendered images
- Determine where coordinates (x, y, z) map to on the model
- Identify what part of the structure this corresponds to

**3c. Verify position reasonableness:**

 

For revolute joints:



- ① Origin should be at the hinge/pivot location
- ② Verify this is where rotation occurs visually
- ③ Check fixed part vs. moving part alignment

For prismatic joints:



- ① Origin should be at the slide rail starting point
- ② Verify this is where linear motion begins
- ③ Check slide direction aligns with axis

General checks:



- ① Is distance from model origin reasonable? (not abnormally far, e.g., >10 units)
- ② Does this position make physical sense for the connection?

**3d. Assign position score (0-10):**



- 10: Optimal and logical pivot/connection point
- 5-9: Reasonable location, minor improvements possible
- 0-4: Poor placement causing functional issues

**Step 4: Write reasoning for each joint**

 

**Required format** - must reference both URDF values and visual evidence:



```
"The URDF defines this as a [type] joint with origin xyz='[x y z]' and axis xyz='[x y z]'. 
Visually, the origin coordinates correspond to [describe location on model], which is [assessment]. 
The [type] joint type is [correct/incorrect] because [functional reasoning based on visual context]. 
The origin position is [appropriate/inappropriate] because [spatial reasoning referencing images]."
```

**Step 5: Calculate joint score**

 

For each joint: `(type_score + position_score) / 2`

 

Overall joint_score: Average of all individual joint scores

 

**Step 6: Determine success flag**

 

Set `success = true` if and only if:



- `link_position_score >= 8.0` **AND**
- `joint_score >= 8.0`

Otherwise: `success = false`

 

**Step 7: Compile final output**

 

Verify complete JSON structure with all required fields.



------

#### Important Guidelines

**Link Position Evaluation:**



- Use **only** the rendered images
- Do not reference URDF data for this task
- Focus on visual plausibility
- Check for obvious physical violations

**Joint Evaluation:**



- **Must** use both URDF content and rendered images
- Type evaluation: Visual function determines correctness
- Position evaluation: Visual location determines reasonableness
- Reasoning must explicitly reference both data sources

**Reasoning Requirements:**



- For joints, always cite specific URDF values (origin xyz, axis xyz)
- Always describe visual correspondence ("which visually corresponds to...")
- Explain your assessment with clear reasoning
- Be specific about what makes something correct or incorrect

**Success Criteria:**



- High bar: Both scores must be 8.0 or higher
- Indicates production-ready quality
- Lower scores require iteration and refinement

**Scoring Philosophy:**



- 0-2: Severe structural problems or completely wrong choices
- 3-4: Major issues requiring significant corrections
- 5-6: Functional but suboptimal, noticeable improvements needed
- 7-8: Good quality, minor refinements possible
- 9-10: Excellent to perfect match with real-world expectations

## Verifier Module

### Threshold Verifier

**Source File**: `articulate_anything/agent/verifier/threshold_verifier.py`



------

#### Task Description

ThresholdVerifier determines when to stop iterative refinement based on multiple criteria: score thresholds, iteration limits, and convergence detection.

 

It evaluates historical results to decide whether the system should continue generating improved models or stop because quality is sufficient or further iteration is unlikely to help.

 

**Input Format:**



```python
results: List[Dict[str, Any]]
# Each result contains:
# - iteration: int (iteration number)
# - seed: int (random seed)
# - feedback_score: float (0-10 scale)
# - position_score: float (0-10 scale, optional)
# - joint_score: float (0-10 scale, optional)
```

**Configuration Parameters (10-point scale):**



- `position_threshold`: Position score threshold (default: 7.0/10)
- `joint_threshold`: Joint score threshold (default: 8.0/10)
- `overall_threshold`: Overall score threshold (default: 7.5/10)
- `max_iterations`: Maximum iteration count (default: 10)
- `patience`: Early stop patience - iterations without improvement (default: 3)

**Output:**



- `should_continue()` → Boolean decision (True: continue, False: stop)
- `get_stop_reason()` → String explanation

------

#### Action Library (Stopping Conditions)

**Condition 1: Maximum Iterations Reached**



- **Check**: Current iteration >= max_iterations
- **Priority**: Highest (prevents infinite loops)
- **Decision**: Stop immediately
- **Reason**: "Reached maximum iterations {max_iterations}"

**Condition 2: Overall Threshold Met**



- **Check**: Current feedback_score >= overall_threshold
- **Priority**: High (primary success criterion)
- **Decision**: Stop with success
- **Reason**: "Reached overall threshold {threshold}/10 (current: {score}/10)"

**Condition 3: Multi-dimensional Thresholds Met**



- **Check**: position_score >= position_threshold AND joint_score >= joint_threshold
- **Priority**: High (component-wise success)
- **Decision**: Stop with success
- **Reason**: "Position and joint both reached threshold (position: {pos}/10, joint: {joint}/10)"

**Condition 4: Patience Exhausted (No Improvement)**



- **Check**: no_improvement_count >= patience
- **Priority**: Medium (early stopping to save computation)
- **Decision**: Stop to prevent wasted effort
- **Reason**: "No improvement for {patience} consecutive iterations (best: {best_score}/10)"

**Condition 5: Continue Iteration**



- **Check**: None of the above conditions met
- **Decision**: Continue with next iteration
- **Effects**: Increment iteration counter, proceed to next refinement

------

#### Chain of Thought

**Step 1: Receive and validate input**

 

Based on the historical results list:



- If results is empty, this is the first iteration → return True (continue)
- Otherwise, extract the latest result

**Step 2: Extract evaluation metrics**

 

From the latest result:



- Current iteration number
- Current feedback score (overall quality)
- Current position score (if available)
- Current joint score (if available)

**Step 3: Check Condition 1 - Maximum iterations**

 

Verify iteration limit:



- ① State: Current iteration = {iteration}
- ② Check: Is current_iteration >= max_iterations?
- ③ If yes:
  - Set stop_reason = "Reached maximum iterations {max_iterations}"
  - Log decision
  - Return False (stop)

**Step 4: Check Condition 2 - Overall threshold**

 

Verify overall quality:



- ① State: Current feedback score = {score}/10
- ② Check: Is current_score >= overall_threshold?
- ③ If yes:
  - Set stop_reason = "Reached overall threshold {threshold}/10 (current: {score}/10)"
  - Log decision
  - Return False (stop with success)

**Step 5: Check Condition 3 - Component thresholds**

 

If detailed scores are available:



- ① State: Position score = {position}/10, Joint score = {joint}/10
- ② Check: Are both position_score >= position_threshold AND joint_score >= joint_threshold?
- ③ If yes:
  - Set stop_reason = "Position and joint both reached threshold (position: {pos}/10, joint: {joint}/10)"
  - Log decision
  - Return False (stop with success)

**Step 6: Update improvement tracking**

 

Track score progression:



- ① Compare: current_score vs. best_score
- ② If current_score > best_score:
  - Update best_score = current_score
  - Reset no_improvement_count = 0
- ③ Else (no improvement):
  - Increment no_improvement_count += 1

**Step 7: Check Condition 4 - Patience exhausted**

 

Verify convergence:



- ① State: No improvement count = {count}, Patience = {patience}
- ② Check: Is no_improvement_count >= patience?
- ③ If yes:
  - Set stop_reason = "No improvement for {patience} consecutive iterations (best: {best_score}/10)"
  - Log decision
  - Return False (stop due to convergence)

**Step 8: All checks passed - continue**

 

No stopping condition met:



- ① Log decision to continue
- ② Return True (proceed to next iteration)

------

#### Important Guidelines

**Decision Priority:**



1. Always check maximum iterations first (safety)
2. Then check success thresholds (goal achievement)
3. Finally check early stopping (efficiency)
4. Continue only if all checks pass

**State Management:**



- Track best_score across iterations to detect improvement
- Maintain no_improvement_count for patience mechanism
- Reset improvement counter when score increases

**Logging:**



- Log every decision with context (iteration, scores)
- Include reason in stop messages
- Facilitate debugging and analysis

**Threshold Philosophy:**



- Overall threshold: Global quality bar
- Component thresholds: Fine-grained quality control
- Both approaches valid for stopping

------

#### Examples

**Example 1: Success - Threshold Reached**



```
Configuration: overall_threshold=7.5, position_threshold=7.0, joint_threshold=8.0

Iteration 1: feedback=5.2, position=6.0, joint=4.5
→ Decision: Continue (below all thresholds)

Iteration 2: feedback=6.8, position=7.2, joint=6.5
→ Decision: Continue (joint below threshold)

Iteration 3: feedback=7.9, position=8.1, joint=7.8
→ Decision: Continue (joint below threshold 8.0)

Iteration 4: feedback=8.2, position=8.5, joint=8.0
→ Decision: STOP
→ Reason: "Position and joint both reached threshold (position: 8.5>=7.0/10, joint: 8.0>=8.0/10)"
```

**Example 2: Early Stop - No Improvement**



```
Configuration: patience=3

Iteration 1: feedback=5.0
→ best_score=5.0, no_improvement_count=0
→ Decision: Continue

Iteration 2: feedback=4.8
→ best_score=5.0, no_improvement_count=1
→ Decision: Continue

Iteration 3: feedback=4.9
→ best_score=5.0, no_improvement_count=2
→ Decision: Continue

Iteration 4: feedback=4.7
→ best_score=5.0, no_improvement_count=3
→ Decision: STOP
→ Reason: "No improvement for 3 consecutive iterations (best: 5.0/10)"
```

**Example 3: Maximum Iterations**



```
Configuration: max_iterations=10, overall_threshold=8.0

Iteration 1-9: feedback gradually increases (5.0 → 7.8) but never reaches 8.0

Iteration 10: feedback=7.8
→ Decision: STOP
→ Reason: "Reached maximum iterations 10"
```

------

#### Adaptive Threshold Variant

**Additional Task Description**

 

AdaptiveThresholdVerifier extends the base verifier with dynamic threshold adjustment. The threshold decreases over iterations, making it progressively easier to satisfy stopping criteria.

 

**Additional Configuration:**



- `threshold_decay`: Decay multiplier applied periodically (default: 0.95)
- `min_threshold`: Floor value for threshold (default: 5.0/10)
- `adaptation_interval`: Iterations between adjustments (default: 3)

**Additional Chain of Thought Step (Insert after Step 2):**

 

**Step 2b: Adapt threshold if needed**

 

Check if threshold should be adjusted:



- ① Calculate: current_iteration % adaptation_interval
- ② If remainder == 0 and iteration > 0:
  - Compute new_threshold = max(overall_threshold × threshold_decay, min_threshold)
  - If new_threshold ≠ overall_threshold:
    - Log: "Adapting threshold: {old} → {new}"
    - Update: overall_threshold = new_threshold

Then proceed with normal verification steps using the updated threshold.

 

**Example: Gradual Threshold Reduction**



```
Configuration:
- initial overall_threshold = 8.0
- threshold_decay = 0.95
- min_threshold = 5.0
- adaptation_interval = 3

Iteration 1: score=6.5, threshold=8.0 → Continue
Iteration 2: score=6.8, threshold=8.0 → Continue
Iteration 3: score=7.0, threshold=8.0 
  → Adapt: 8.0 × 0.95 = 7.6
  → Continue with threshold=7.6

Iteration 4: score=7.2, threshold=7.6 → Continue
Iteration 5: score=7.3, threshold=7.6 → Continue
Iteration 6: score=7.4, threshold=7.6
  → Adapt: 7.6 × 0.95 = 7.22
  → Continue with threshold=7.22

Iteration 7: score=7.5, threshold=7.22
  → Decision: STOP
  → Reason: "Reached overall threshold 7.22/10 (current: 7.5/10)"
```

**Benefit**: Balances high quality standards early with practical convergence later. Prevents endless iteration while maintaining quality goals.



------

## Appendix: Scoring Standards

All evaluators use a unified **10-point scale**:



| Score Range | Quality Level         | Description                                         | Examples                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **0-2**     | Severe Errors         | Completely wrong choices or major structural issues | Wrong joint type, major part missing, severe intersections   |
| **3-4**     | Major Problems        | Obvious errors requiring significant correction     | Wrong joint axis, severely misplaced parts, floating components |
| **5-6**     | Functional but Flawed | Basic correctness with clear room for improvement   | Suboptimal joint origin, alignment issues, small gaps        |
| **7-8**     | Good Quality          | Close to ground truth with minor differences        | Reasonable joint parameters, mostly correct positioning, minor visual differences |
| **9-10**    | Excellent/Perfect     | Matches or nearly matches ground truth              | All parameters correct, visual perfect match                 |

**Success Criteria (Task Completion):**



- Typically requires scores ≥ 8.0 across evaluated dimensions
- Indicates production-ready quality
- Lower scores trigger iteration and refinement
