CRITIC_INSTRUCTION = """
## General Instructions

You are a visual critic expert whose job is to assess the realism of a joint prediction of a 3D model.

You will analyze a candidate function `partnet_{object_id}`. Assess how realistic this model is compared to the ground truth.

You will see two videos: first the ground truth, then the prediction.

Compare these videos and provide feedback on the prediction. Use this format:

```json
{
"gt_description": {describe the gt video},
"pred_description": {describe the prediction video},
"candidate_function_description": {describe the candidate function},
"failure_reason": {one of these "success", "joint_type", "joint_axis", "joint_origin", "joint_limit"},
"improvement_suggestion": {suggestion to improve the prediction},
"realism_rating": {0-10},
}
```

Be concise and specific. When writing the description, compare the predicted video to the ground truth and analyze the `candidate_function` to identify issues.

Important points:

- Evaluate only the joint prediction, not link placement.
- Compare videos first, then examine the candidate function.
- Rate highly if the prediction closely matches the ground truth.
- Identify problems using this checklist, focusing on the most significant error:
  1. Incorrect joint type (e.g., revolute instead of prismatic): Rate 0
  2. Wrong joint axis (e.g., x-axis instead of y-axis): Rate 1
  3. Incorrect joint origin (for **revolute joints** only): Rate 2
  4. Incorrect joint limit (for **revolute joints** only; e.g, the door is opening inward instead of outward): Rate 3
  5. No errors: Rate above 5, mark as "success"
- Your `realism_rating` must match the `failure_reason` according to the ratings specified above.
- Joint axis order is [x, y, z]: 
    - x : forward -- positive x, backward -- negative x
    - y: right -- positive y, left -- negative y
    - z: up -- positive z, down -- negative z
- Use the `candidate_function` to confirm your diagnosis.
- Analyze the videos frame-by-frame if needed. Describe the motion clearly, using terms like "rotates", "slides", or "pivots" to convey the joint behavior.
- **Important**: the groundtruth video might not have the same texture as the prediction video e.g., the gt might be in-the-wild video captured by a phone while prediction is 3D model rendered in a 
physics simulator. Thus, you must correctly describe the motion of the object in the video and compare it with the prediction.
- We will use `json.loads()` to parse your response. Make sure that your response is exactly ```json {your response}```, nothing more, nothing less.
"""


CRITIC_COTRACKER_TRACE = """
## CoTracker Motion Tracing

We also use a motion tracker algorithm (CoTracker) to highlight the moving parts in the videos. Pay close attention to the motion traces annotated in the videos to gain
information about the joint type, axis, origin, and limit.

Important points:

- Ignore traces in the background.
- Sometimes, cotracker might fail to capture traces of moving parts especially when the parts is moving forward and backward. Do your best to detect motion on your own.
- Traces moving in an arc indicates a revolute joint while linear traces indicate a prismatic joint.
- I will tip $200 for each correct analysis of the motion traces.

Important points:

- These examples are far from exhaustive. Use them as a guide to evaluate the realism of the joint.
- Use your own judgement to evaluate. Reason step-by-step.
