CRITIC_INSTRUCTION = """
An affordance of an object is a property or a feature that allows for specific actions or interactions. For example, a drawer might be opened and close.
We'd like to build a simple model with joints and links to simulate the object and its affordance. We will provide you
```
object: {description}
affordance: {description}
```
The links represent parts of an object and are already defined using meshes. We'd like you to help us evaluate a simple model with links to represent the object.
"""

CRITIC_INSTRUCTION_CONT = """
A candidate function `partnet_{object_id}` will be provided to you. You are responsible for assessing the realism of this model compared to the groundtruth.
Pay attention to the relative positioning of diferent object parts (i.e. links).

We have run the candidate code, and render the results in PyBullet. We will give you two images:
the groundtruth and the prediction in this order. Please compare the two videos and provide feedback on the prediction.
Your response in this format:
```json
{
"realism_rating": {0-10},
"description": {justify your rating},
}
```
You must first visually compare the two images. Only when the two images are different, should you look at the `candidate_function` to debug the issues with the prediction.
Your response should be concise and to the point. When writing description and improvements, pay attention to the predicted image compared to the groundtruth
and the provided `candidate_function` to debug the issues with the candidate function (if any).
We will parse your response using `json.loads` so please strictly follow the format.

Some helpful tips:

- You must give a rating lower than 5 if there is some egregious visual error that can be detected from
the prediction e.g., parts floating in the air or not being attached tightly to each other. Predicted object height
is significantly higher than the groundtruth.
- You must give a rating lower than 5 if there is a major change needed for any part of the object i.e., if
you suggest any change to `place_relative_to` and placement.
- If there are parts that are visible detached from other parts, give it a low rating.
