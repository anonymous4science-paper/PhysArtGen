You are an experienced CAD designer. Please assist me in crafting an articulated object. Each object is represented using a rectangular bounding box. Start out by describing all the parts that is needed to acheive the desired function. Describe their bounding box (width(x, depth, +front/-back), length(y, width, +right/-left), height(z, height, +up/-down). Provide dimensions in a way such that only translation is necessary to assemble the parts in the correct way. The object should face the positive x direction by default.

# Example 1:

## Prompt: 

Design a fridge for an 1b1b apartment. The fridge should have a top freezer and a bottom refrigerator.

## Response:

Estimation: A typical top freezer fridge has a dimension of 

•	Height: 60-68 inches (152-173 cm)
•	Width: 28-33 inches (71-84 cm)
•	Depth: 28-34 inches (71-86 cm)

I should create parts that will stay within these bounds
Articulations of a fridge: 

•   I should be able to open the refrigerator door
•   I should be able to open the freezer door
•   (Additional requirements)...

Final Dimensions: [0.7, 0.8, 1.7]

Reasoning: I will create a fridge body of dimension [0.7, 0.8, 1.7], matching the final dimensions of the object. Then, I will create two doors of dimension [0.1, 0.8, 0.4] and [0.1, 0.8, 1.2] respectively. 
The smaller door (0.4) is the freezer while the larger door (1.2) is the main refrigerator door. The doors and body are stacked along the x-axis, creating the 1.6m height. 
This is roughly the height of the `fridge_body` (1.7). 

Parts:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "fridge_body",
        "description": "The main body of the fridge",
        "dimensions": [0.6, 0.8, 1.7]
    },
    {
        "name": "top_freezer_door",
        "description": "The top door for the refrigerator that can be opened via a hinge",
        "dimensions": [0.1, 0.8, 0.4]
    },

        "description": "The bottom door for the refrigerator that can be opened via a hinge",

    }

# Example 2:

## Prompt:

Design a dresser with a double door cabinet on top and two drawers on the bottom.

## Response:

Estimation: A typical dresser with a double door cabinet on top and two drawers on the bottom has dimensions of:

	•	Height: 48 inches (122 cm)
	•	Width: 36 inches (91 cm)
	•	Depth: 18 inches (46 cm)

I should create parts that will stay within these bounds.
Articulations of a dresser:

	•	I should be able to open the cabinet doors
	•	I should be able to slide out the drawers

Final Dimensions: 

    •	X: 0.46 is as deep as the dresser body
    •	Y: 0.91m is as wide as the dresser body
    •	Z: 1.22m is as tall as the dresser body
    •	Dimensions: [0.48, 0.91, 1.22]

Reasoning: I will create a dresser body of dimensions [0.46, 0.91, 1.22], matching the final dimensions of the object. Then, we will create two cabinet doors of dimensions [0.02, 0.45, 0.61] each, 
and two drawers of dimensions [0.44, 0.91, 0.3] each. The doors will have hinges along the Y-axis, and the drawers will slide along the X-axis.
So the height of horizontally stacked doors combined with two vertically stacked drawers are 0.61 + 0.3 * 2 = 1.21 ~ the height of the dresser body (1.22).

Parts:

```json

    {
        "name": "dresser_body",
        "description": "The main body of the dresser",
        "dimensions": [0.46, 0.91, 1.22]
    },
    {
        "name": "cabinet_door_left",
        "description": "The left door of the cabinet that can be opened via a hinge",
        "dimensions": [0.02, 0.45, 0.61]
    },
    {
        "name": "cabinet_door_right",
        "description": "The right door of the cabinet that can be opened via a hinge",
        "dimensions": [0.02, 0.45, 0.61]

        "description": "The top drawer of the dresser that can be slid out",
        "dimensions": [0.44, 0.91, 0.3]
    },
    {
        "name": "drawer_2",
        "description": "The bottom drawer of the dresser that can be slid out",
        "dimensions": [0.44, 0.91, 0.3]
    }
]
```


# Example 3

## Prompt:

Design a public toilet that is wall-mounted and has a seat on top with a lever for flushing on the side.

## Response:

Estimation: A typical wall-mounted public toilet has dimensions of:

•	Height: 22-24 inches (56-61 cm)
•	Width: 14-17 inches (36-43 cm)
•	Depth: 20-24 inches (51-61 cm)

I should create parts that will stay within these bounds.
Articulations of a public toilet:

•	I should be able to lift the toilet seat
•	I should be able to press the lever to flush

Final Dimensions: [0.61, 0.43, 0.55]

Reasoning: I will create the toilet body of dimensions [0.5, 0.43, 0.55], matching the final dimensions of the object. Then, I will create a toilet seat of dimensions [0.3, 0.43, 0.02], 
and a flush lever of dimensions [0.09, 0.02, 0.1]. Note that the `toilet_seat` has very small height (0.02), same width (0.43) as the body but half the length. 
The hinge for the seat will be on the Y-axis, and the lever will rotate around the Y-axis.

Parts:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "toilet_body",
    "description": "The main body of the toilet that should be wall-mounted",
    "dimensions": [
      0.5,

      0.55
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "toilet_seat",
    "description": "The seat of the toilet that can be lifted",
    "dimensions": [

# Example 4

### Prompt:

Design an office chair

### Response:

Estimation: A typical office chair has dimensions of:

Height: 20-30inches (51-76 cm)
Width: 20-30 inches (51-76 cm)
Depth: 20-25 inches (51-64 cm)

I should create parts that will stay within these bounds.
Articulations of an office chair:

The chair seat should be able to rotate around the vertical axis
The chair should be able to roll on its wheels

Final Dimensions: [0.60, 0.60, 0.7]
Reasoning: I will create a chair seat of dimensions [0.50, 0.50, 0.60], which will serve as the main body of the chair. The chair leg will be a central column supporting the seat, with dimensions [0.2, 0.2, 0.1]. The wheels will be attached to the base of the leg, extending the total width and depth to 0.60m. 

Parts:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "office_chair_seat",
    "description": "The main seat of the office chair, including the backrest, that can rotate",
    "dimensions": [0.50, 0.50, 0.60]
  },
  {
    "name": "office_chair_leg",
    "description": "The central support column of the chair connecting the seat to the wheels",
    "dimensions": [0.2, 0.2, 0.1]
  },
  {
    "name": "office_chair_wheel_1",
    "description": "One of the four wheels attached to the base of the chair leg",
    "dimensions": [0.05, 0.05, 0.05]
  },
  {
    "name": "office_chair_wheel_2",
    "description": "One of the four wheels attached to the base of the chair leg",
    "dimensions": [0.05, 0.05, 0.05]
  },
  {
    "name": "office_chair_wheel_3",
    "description": "One of the four wheels attached to the base of the chair leg",
    "dimensions": [0.05, 0.05, 0.05]
  },
  {
    "name": "office_chair_wheel_4",
    "description": "One of the four wheels attached to the base of the chair leg",
    "dimensions": [0.05, 0.05, 0.05]
  }
]
```

This design includes the chair seat (which incorporates the backrest), the central leg, and four wheels as specified. The dimensions are chosen to create a realistic office chair that fits within the estimated size range while allowing for proper articulation and movement.


Follow these tips carefully:

1. Conventions:
- Rotations on the Z-axis swing the object left/right. 

2. You are only responsible for the primary 3D layout of the design. Only design for bounding box functional areas. Do not worry about details like walls and paneling dimensions as they will be filled once bounding boxes are finalized.

3. Give a realistic estimate of the final dimension of the object in the response. When assembled, your parts MUST stay within the final dimension estimate.

4. 
- Think EXHAUSTIVELY about ALL OF the movements that can occur with this articulation Eg. (WHEELS, SLIDERS, HINGES). 
- You SHOULD have a EXPLICIT bounding box designed for EACH articulation. 
- Think carefully about which axis the articulation will occur on as this impacts how you design bounding box and their placements. 
- Knobs, wheels, and other freely rotating parts should have a square component in their bounding box.

5. 
- **DO NOT design REDUNDANT bounding boxes** that are not strictly nessary for the design. Redundant boxes create issues as each part is converted to a meshed URDF link. 
- You are allowed to have overlapping bounding boxes if say for example:
    - A drawer is meant to slide into a cabinet
    - A part is meant to slide into another part
- Try to keep the part count *below* 6.

6. 
- Think CAREFULLY about how your parts contribute to the final dimensions of the object. Give calculation for each dimension.
- For example: If you intend on creating an object of size [1,0.25,2] from stacking two objects over the y-axis, you **SHOULD and MUST create two parts of dimensions [1,0.125,2] and [1,0.125,2] INSTEAD OF [1,0.25,2] and [1,0.25,2]**. Doing the latter is INCORRECT and would result in double the dimension along the y-axis.
Note that the in the correct solution the y-axis add up 0.125 + 0.125 = 0.25 which is the final dimension of the object.
- To avoid incorrect dimensions, consider the effect of assembly on the final dimensions. 
- Your final dimension is the minimal box that contains all the parts, this includes potential protrusions from handles, knobs, etc.

7.
- Follow the examples to give justification for the dimensions of the parts, especially how they contribute to the final dimensions of the object body.
- E.g., vertically stacked parts should generally add up to the height of the object body/frame ect.

8.
- Additional requirements:  the object is oriented upright
- You should follow the output format EXACTLY as shown in the examples above.

9. 
- We will use a CLIP score to find the mesh that best matches each part `name`. So try to use descriptive `name` that can narrow down specific properties of the part.
For example, you might name `suitcase_retractable_handle` instead of `handle` to make it easier to find the correct mesh.

10. The json parts should have the following format:
```json
[
    {
        "name": "part_name",
        "description": "part_description",
        "dimensions": [x, y, z],
    },
    ...
]
```
Make sure that `description` is descriptive so that our mesh matching algorithm can find the correct mesh for the part.

11. Use your common sense to make sure that you only create needed parts. For example, if you already have a `toilet_bowl`, then you should not create a `toilet_body` because the `toilet_bowl` would already play that role.
